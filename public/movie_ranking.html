<h1>The Best Movies from different genre in telugu film industry according to GEETHIKA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bahubhali-2</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Action Drama.Right from the word go, it has intense drama and action as every frame in the film is a visual wonder. Be it the heroic fights or the lavish war. A big apppreciation to the director Rajamouli for making this epic story whice gave good exposure for telugu film industry in the world.</p>
<h3>Khushi</h3>
<p>Its a feel good love Story. The story line and hero Pawan Kalyan's attitude in the film is irreplaceable.</p>
<h3>Jersey</h3>
<p>The bonding between father and son are the highlights of the film which makes audience to feel emotional and connected. </p>
<h3>Rangasthalam</h3>
<p>Its a periodic revenge drama which has good technical aspects that gives audience good experience to watch. The cast of the film gave thier best in the film.</p>
<h3>AWE!</h3>
<P>AWE is a scientific triller and a crafty anthology movie which relies too heavily on the strength of its climax. Too psychological, too poetic at times.</P>
